## CustomUserManager Class Manual

### Overview

The `CustomUserManager` class in Django is a custom model manager for user models where email is used as the unique identifier for authentication, instead of the traditional username. This manual explains the functionality and usage of the `CustomUserManager` class.

### Class Definition

```python
class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    """
    Custom user model manager where email is the unique identifiers
    for authentication instead of usernames.
    """
```

**Purpose**: To provide custom methods for creating users and superusers with email as the primary identifier.

### Methods

#### 1. create_user

```python
def create_user(self, email, password, **extra_fields):
    """
    Create and save a user with the given email and password.
    """
```

**Parameters**:
- `email` (str): The email address of the user.
- `password` (str): The password for the user.
- `**extra_fields` (dict): Additional fields for the user model.

**Functionality**:
- Validates that an email is provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- Normalizes the email address to create a standard format.
- Creates a new user instance with the provided email and extra fields.
- Sets and hashes the user's password for security.
- Saves the user instance to the database.

**Usage**:
- Used to create regular user accounts.

#### 2. create_superuser

```python
def create_superuser(self, email, password, **extra_fields):
    """
    Create and save a SuperUser with the given email and password.
    """
```

**Parameters**:
- `email` (str): The email address of the superuser.
- `password` (str): The password for the superuser.
- `**extra_fields` (dict): Additional fields for the superuser model.

**Functionality**:
- Sets default values for `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, and `is_active` to `True`.
- Validates that the `is_staff` and `is_superuser` fields are set to `True`. Raises a `ValueError` if they are not.
- Utilizes the `create_user` method to create a superuser instance.

**Usage**:
- Used to create superuser accounts with full administrative access.

### Error Handling

- Both methods include checks to ensure that the necessary fields are provided and valid.
- If the required conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.

### Localization

- The class uses `gettext_lazy` for error messages, allowing them to be translated into different languages, supporting internationalization.

### Integration with Custom User Model

- This manager is typically used in a custom user model where the `USERNAME_FIELD` is set to `'email'`.
- It replaces the default user manager to handle user creation and authentication via email.
